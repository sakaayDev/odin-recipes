        <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>½ cup orange marmalade</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Stir in whole-wheat noodles and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is firm to the bite, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain well and set aside.

    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Combine chicken stock, orange marmalade, tamari sauce, whole ginger root piece, and ground black pepper in a pot over medium-high heat.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Bring sauce to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Simmer until sauce reduces and thickens; about 20 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Remove sauce from heat. Stir in lemon juice and set aside.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Cook and stir chicken in hot oil until golden, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Remove chicken from skillet and set aside, leaving oil in the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>Cook and stir the stir-fry vegetables in the same skillet used for the chicken until vegetables are almost tender, 4 to 5 minutes</p>

    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <p>Remove ginger root piece from sauce and discard.</p>

    <h3>Step 11</h3>
    <p>Stir chicken and sauce into vegetables and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 12</h3>
    <p>Serve over whole-wheat noodles.</p>
